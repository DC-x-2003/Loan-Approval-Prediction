# Loan-Approval-Prediction

**Introduction**

Loan approval is a critical process for financial institutions, and making accurate predictions can save time and resources. This project leverages historical loan data to train machine learning models that can predict whether a loan application will be approved or not. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and optimization.

**Dataset**

The dataset used in this project contains information about loan applicants, such as: 

1. Loan ID
2. Gender 
3. Married
4. Dependents 
5. Education 
6. Self Employed 
7. Applicant Income
8. Co-Applicant Income 
9. Loan Amount 
10. Loan Amount Term
11. Credit History 
12. Property Area
13. Loan Status

**Modeling and Prediction**

The project uses various machine learning algorithms to predict loan approval, including:

1. Decision Tree Classifier
2. Naive Bayes Classifier

**Results**

The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy.
