# Loan-Approval-Prediction
Loan approval is a critical process for financial institutions, and making accurate predictions can save time and resources. This project leverages historical loan data to train machine learning models that can predict whether a loan application will be approved or not. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and optimization.
